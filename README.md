## Getting Started

> Note: If you wish to add features there is [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs) that can help 

1. Clone this repo locally
      
      ```
      git clone https://github.com/ChrisDizenzo/tictactoe.git
      ```
2. Attach the dependencies using cocoapods
      > Note: If you dont have CocoaPods install is very easy and is [here](https://cocoapods.org/) 

      ```
      git clone https://github.com/ChrisDizenzo/tictactoe.git
      ```
      ```
      pod install
      ```
3. Open the .xcworkspace file created after the pod install. If you open the project file then socketio will not be attached and it will fail

## Adding Features

If you wish to add features to a view, read the documentation for that view controller. The documentation even has examples!
